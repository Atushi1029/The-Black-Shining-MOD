It seeks to organise society by other means, through voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups. Such socialists are often regarded by the mainstream left as traitors to the revolution. Anarcho-Communists, while seeking communist institutions, have no wider state structures, pursue complete egalitarianism, equality and freedom from all gods and masters, and reject all or most authoritative positions."

 totalitarian_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "Totalitarian Socialism refers to a grouping of loosely connected extremely radical socialist ideologies, which employ hyper-militarization as well as direct state control of all assets. \nPopularized in leftist camps after the defeat of the Soviet Union, early totalists believed that the socialist world did not go far enough in preparing for the inevitable conflict with Germany, as well as preparing for global revolution. As such, they called for complete collectivization and the preparation of the state to spread its influence and subsequent idealogy in the name of the liberation of the proletariat. \nTotalitarian Socialist regimes employ various methods to not only consolidate their power but to keep their citizen's lives entirely surveyed and controlled. These range from expansive police and surveillance forces, to elaborate propaganda campaigns; which in turn means that internal dissent is almost entirely non-existent. \nTotalitarian Socialists are now concentrated in Russia, as well as German-dominated Europe, with smaller movements present in South East Asia and the Middle East. These regimes now call for the complete eradication of the anti-revolutionary states across the globe; and their replacement with a suitable government."

Named after the Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, it is an ideology based on his writings and positions him as the greatest Marxist theorist after Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.\nIt relies on the doctrines of internationalism and anti-imperialism, but differs from traditional Bolshevism in its emphasis on the rural people rather than the urban proletariat. It considers guerrilla warfare in the form of 'long-term people's war' to be the best way of revolutionary struggle in the fight against capitalist rule in places where rural traditions remain.\nMaoism is the natural inheritor of Marxist thought and is considered by its supporters to be the next stage of Bolshevism. Its fundamental anti-imperialist principles have been adopted throughout the world and oppressed people of all kinds are beginning to take up arms against their own oppressors. This new revolutionary departure from traditional Marxist thought is beginning to leave its mark on world history."

Pan-Africanism, which falls on the left end of the political spectrum, can be easily distinguished from its one half, African socialism, by its avant-garde stance, including its emphasis on anti-imperialism and its stubborn adherence to a pan-national identity that Europe once called the 'Dark Continent'.\nIts supporters are found mainly in East and West Africa, but its ideas have penetrated from Cape Town to Cairo, and even into black communities in the USA and the Caribbean.

It is a syncretic ideology. On the other hand, however, it also strongly panders to military centralisation, nationalism and SR Narodism ideology. \nThe regime's most prominent implementer, Lev Savinkov, integrated the SR into the ROA, creating a unique system that was socialist but, unlike the foolish communism of the Bolsheviks, had aspects of military nationalism."

While retaining socialism as a long-term goal, social democracy is distinguished from some modern forms of democratic socialism for seeking to humanize capitalism and create the conditions for it to lead to greater democratic, egalitarian, and solidaristic outcomes. \nAs such, Social Democracy works with other centrists to ensure it’s legislation is passed in a reasonable manner that appeases both sides of the aisle.

Countries that have fallen into this situation can be found all over the world. The denunciation of cruel colonialism, that is leftist patriotism. This is a positive assessment of colonisation, unlike the nationalism created by the victors. The reason is that colonisation allows people to experience a common revolutionary struggle, which in turn can be a factor contributing to national unity. Leftist patriotism does not speak of the superiority of their own people and culture, but advocates that they should unite to defeat the invaders.

Generally, Popular Fronts are set up when there is a significant change in the status quo or when there is concern about the possibility of such a change, in order for the various camps to temporarily put their differences aside to fight elections, military conflicts and so on.\nThe definition of a popular front is as broad as its internal structure. People's Fronts are set up after minimum conditions are put in place to counter threats. In other cases, when insiders differ in ideology, be it socialist or liberal, they may find common ground in policies and ideas and link this to the unity of the People's Front. The overall strategy can be an agreement to vote in unity with each other, or an agreement to support each other during direct action in the streets, whichever is stronger."

It is the spark for the rise of conservative and libertarian organisations, parties and intellectuals, and is mainly advocated by them. It is generally associated with economic liberalisation policies such as privatisation, deregulation, globalisation, free trade, monetarism, austerity and reductions in government spending to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society. The characteristics of neo liberalism, both in ideology and practice, have been the subject of much scholarly debate. \nAs an economic idea, neo liberalism emerged among European liberals in the 1930s. They saw the central ideas of classical liberalism decline in popularity after the First Great Depression, driven by a desire to manipulate markets, and sought to revive and evolve, creating improved policies to counter free market fluctuations and mitigate their negative social effects. One driver of policy formulation to mitigate free market fluctuations was the desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, with the failures sometimes attributed primarily to classical liberal economic policies."

It should be noted however that various camps of conservatism exist; ranging from Paternalists who seek to improve the situation of their countrymen through more conservative means, to \nNeo-Conservatives who attempt to bring direct force against the enemies they are faced with; in an attempt to prevent the ousting of their traditions."

In particular, traditionalism and libertarianism often conflict. For example, the emphasis on the Christian spirit caused political conflicts between traditionalists and Christian fundamentalists and libertarianism, which advocates total free competition. However, it is a mistake to assume that they necessarily have violent disagreements, as evidenced by the fact that figures who adhere to libertarianism agree with Christian opposition to abortion and homosexuals. \nIn addition, the non-interventionism of traditionalists and libertarianism, which does not pay serious attention to foreign and security policy, caused a very serious political conflict with the active interventionism of the anti-communists."

As such these parties have a complete hold over the political sphere and have total say in how it is shaped. These regimes tend to be both anti-capitalist and anti-socialist; instead favoring a corporatist approach to economics.

Fascism was seen positively in the US because it enabled widespread economic penetration of the West and destroyed the much-feared labour movement and the Left, which William Philips, the US ambassador to Italy from 1936 to 1941, described as 'an attempt to improve the situation of the masses'.

Membership of German-American bands was only open to US citizens of German descent. Its main purpose was to promote a favourable view of Nazi Germany.\nThe band was very active. Members were issued with uniforms and attended training camps. The band held rallies with procedures such as the Nazi emblem and the Hitler-style salute. Its leaders denounced Jewish-American groups, communism, trade unions under Moscow rule and the German product boycott movement. They claimed that George Washington was the 'The First Fascist'. They were not convinced that democracy could work, because he did not believe in it.\nThe culmination of this activity was a rally in Madison Square Garden, New York, on 20 February 1939.

It can be said that the existing corporatism differs significantly in that it is closer to the left.\nThis ideology, which has an ultranationalist aspect, can be said to focus more on management than labour. It is an undeniable fact that zaibatsu and the military have influence in Japan and the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and unlike the Taisei Yokusankai, it can be considered closer to authoritarian autocracy than party politics."

 rea_eurasianism_ideology_desc:0 "Eurasianism is defined in relation to the proposal of a Eurasian super-nation as a social concept that the peoples of Eurasia, from the Carpathian Mountains to the Mongolian steppes, must be integrated into a single social and political group in order to increase national strength and protect against destructive external influences. It is then through preparation and implementation that the passions of the peoples are maximised and social feats are achieved. This approach extends to forcibly integrating Eurasian countries into a single framework in order to realise the doctrine of cultural integration."
