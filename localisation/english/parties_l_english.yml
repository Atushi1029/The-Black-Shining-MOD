 totalitarian_socialism_ideology:0 "Totalitarian Socialism"
 totalitarian_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "Totalitarian Socialism refers to a grouping of loosely connected extremely radical socialist ideologies, which employ hyper-militarization as well as direct state control of all assets. \nPopularized in leftist camps after the defeat of the Soviet Union, early totalists believed that the socialist world did not go far enough in preparing for the inevitable conflict with Germany, as well as preparing for global revolution. As such, they called for complete collectivization and the preparation of the state to spread its influence and subsequent idealogy in the name of the liberation of the proletariat. \nTotalitarian Socialist regimes employ various methods to not only consolidate their power but to keep their citizen's lives entirely surveyed and controlled. These range from expansive police and surveillance forces, to elaborate propaganda campaigns; which in turn means that internal dissent is almost entirely non-existent. \nTotalitarian Socialists are now concentrated in Russia, as well as German-dominated Europe, with smaller movements present in South East Asia and the Middle East. These regimes now call for the complete eradication of the anti-revolutionary states across the globe; and their replacement with a suitable government."

 radical_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "Radical Socialism refers to socialist teachings that seek to completely eradicate and dismantle capitalist and colonialist structures, through direct revolution and the radicalization of the masses. \nThese states seek to control the means of production, exchange, and regulation; as opposed to letting any of the private sectors take control over it.

 moderate_socialism_ideology:0 "Moderate Socialism"
 moderate_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "Moderate Socialism refers to governments that still seek to work within a democratic framework while simultaneously implementing socialism. \nThese governments seek to bring democratic measures into every way of life while using existing capitalist structures to help along the path. These socialists oppose any backslide towards a one-party state, instead favoring a democratic approach to any pressing issue. \nWhile many see socialism as the long-term goal, some are simply concerned with the excesses of capitalism; as well as current progressive issues. As such these governments insist on industrial democracy and the gradual phasing out of capitalist structures in favor of socialist ones."

 social_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "Social Democracy refers to governments that seek to peacefully implement socialist ideals alongside capitalist ones in favor of creating a supervised free market that is beneficial to the general public as opposed to the select few. \nIt is characterized as having large support for welfare systems, minority groups, as well as unions, and other labor organizations. While retaining socialism as a long-term goal, social democracy is distinguished from some modern forms of democratic socialism for seeking to humanize capitalism and create the conditions for it to lead to greater democratic, egalitarian, and solidaristic outcomes. \nAs such, Social Democracy works with other centrists to ensure it’s legislation is passed in a reasonable manner that appeases both sides of the aisle. As such it has seen traction in the free world, most notably the ruling CCF in Canada."

 liberal_democracy_ideology:0 "Liberal Democracy"
 liberal_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "Liberal Democracy refers to governments that seek to address economic and social disparities while also utilizing the free markets to do. Social Liberals tend to hold generally progressive stances on issues pertaining to individual rights but can vary in economic opinion. \nSome conclude that a more conservative approach to spending is more beneficial for the general population, while others' views overlap with those of Social Democracy in their beliefs that the governments should invest in the general welfare of the population, while also intervening in the markets to ensure no unfair practices are involved. \nLiberalisms's popularity among younger and disadvantaged voters has seen it take some of the free world by storm; cementing its place as one of the more dominant political forces in the \nUnited States. Its compatibility with Social Democracy, as well as its ability to work well with less radical Conservatives, have seen it form large coalitions; most notably the Republican - Progressives."
 longism_ideology:0 "Longism"
 longism_ideology_desc:0 "This ideology, based on Russell Long's policies and personality, is as ambiguous as its name suggests. It espouses civic nationalism, deep piety, and leftist populist economics, while ignoring important issues such as race. Characterized by an authoritarian approach to governing, the Longism regime will do anything for the people, even if the people do not necessarily agree."

 social_conservatism_noun:0 "Social Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_desc:0 "Democrat Regime"
 social_conservatism_ideology:0 "Social Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "Social Conservatism refers to governments that seek to retain traditional structures and practices, as opposed to reforming. As such, these governments are typically extremely pro-capitalist, as well as enforcing the social standards considered the “norm”. \nSeeking to capitalize on the free market potential to bring equality to its citizens, and rather than attempting to change the domestic situation of individuals, these governments focus on preserving the institutions of the time; as well as guaranteeing domestic stability. \nThis means these governments are inherently pro-tradition, pro-hierarchy, and pro-realism; anything that sits outside this definition is generally considered on the other side of conservatism. It should be noted however that various camps of conservatism exist; ranging from Paternalists who seek to improve the situation of their countrymen through more conservative means, to \nNeo-Conservatives who attempt to bring direct force against the enemies they are faced with; in an attempt to prevent the ousting of their traditions."
 silent_conservatism_ideology:0 "Silent Conservatism"
 silent_conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "This conservative ideology is so moderate that its equivalent leaders refer to their own supporters and backers as the "silent majority" and the "voice of the voiceless. The idea is based on the idea that "most of the people have moderate views and are not strongly opinionated, so we should listen carefully to their voices." The foundation of this concept is based on mutual trust between the leaders and the people."

 authoritarian_democracy_ideology:0 "Authoritarian Democracy"
 authoritarian_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "Authoritarian Democracy or Totalitarian Democracy refers to democratically elected regimes that resort to authoritarian means to ensure their rule. It is most typically directed by the ruling class in an attempt to “represent” the different interests of society. \nAs such it often directly contradicts democracy; sometimes excluding voters from the picture at all in favor of the “educated” and party loyal. \nThis also refers to states in which one party is so dominant, whether through legitimate or illegitimate means, that the attempts of any other party to take power are completely squashed. As such these parties have a complete hold over the political sphere and have total say in how it is shaped. These regimes tend to be both anti-capitalist and anti-socialist; instead favoring a corporatist approach to economics. This also means that in many instances these governments have fascist or quasi-fascist sympathies; leading to a rivalry with nearly every other involved party."
 dixiecrat_democracy_ideology:0 "Dixiecrat Democracy"
 dixiecrat_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "The Dixiecrat democracy were supported primarily in the U.S. South and initially arose due to regional divisions in the South that opposed the Democratic Party. The establishment was organized as a breakaway faction by many conservative white politicians in the South who opposed the civil rights movement. The Dixiecrats wanted to protect the rights of Southern states to maintain racial segregation, while the party opposed racial integration and wanted to maintain racism and white supremacy in the face of possible federal intervention."

 paternal_autocracy_ideology_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy refers to a state of government in which power is concentrated in the hands of a single power, therefore meaning the restraints found in other systems of government are virtually nonexistent. This means a single individual is responsible for all actions of the nation, while also possibly having advisors or a council. \nWhile this generally applies to monarchies, this is not always the case; it also can apply to military juntas or other forms of civil dictatorships. \nThese governments are also not inherently right or left-wing either; simply led by a single person who has supreme power over all."

 national_corporatism_ideology_desc:0 "National Corporatism, originally finding its ground in Italy before the Second World War, refers to a regime that is characterized by a dictatorial leader, extreme militarism, autocracy, belief in a central hierarchy, and the implementation of corporatism on the national level. \nNational Corporatist regimes employ several methods to hold power, most notably their direct opposition and attacks on freedom of speech and democracy. On top of this, national corporatist regimes also directly oppose anarchism, liberalism, communism, and other forms of socialism. This means national corporatist regimes attempt to create a society where they, and only they, are the viable leader of the state. \nNational corporatist regimes believe that democracy and capitalism are obsolete, and as such must be replaced with more state-controlled methods, with the end goal of achieving complete economic autarky."

 national_socialism_noun:0 "National Socialism"
 national_socialism_desc:0 "Totalitarian Regime"
 national_socialism_ideology:0 "National Socialism"
 national_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "National Socialism, the prevalent idealogy in Nazi-occupied Europe, refers to a system of government, that like fascism is characterized by a dictatorial leader, extreme militarism, autocracy, belief in a central hierarchy, and the implementation of corporatism on the national level. \nIn the German strain of National Socialism, the ultimate goal is to achieve lebensraum for the Aryan Race, while simultaneously wiping out the threats to said race; including liberals, homosexuals, Jews, and communists. This would naturally mean Europe is wholly German. However, variants of the idealogy exist, most notably in the other countries that fought alongside \nGermany in the 2nd World War. Ultimately all their policies are the same; attempting to eradicate outside threats with extreme violence and prejudice, and secure a homeland for their people."

 ultra_nationalism_desc:0 "Totalitarian Regime"
 ultra_nationalism_ideology:0 "Ultra Nationalism"
 ultra_nationalism_ideology_desc:0 "Characterized by extreme jingoism, Ultranationalist regimes seek to completely assert national supremacy through any means necessary. These involve completely preparing the state for what is perceived as an inevitable war, the indoctrination of the general public, an extreme aversion to outside influence and cooperation, and the attempt to ensure the nation's culture rise not only above its neighbors, but the globe as well. \nThese regimes usually gain traction in nations that have been defeated in a large-scale conflict that has seen the almost complete destruction of their nation or their way of life. Using the population's desire for vengeance, these regimes are able to conscript thousands, if not millions of indoctrinated soldiers ready to reclaim their nation's lost glory; or die trying."

 religious_nationalism_ideology_desc:0 "Theocracy is characterized as a system of governance that has a religious basis, or claims divine deities are giving guidance to the human rulers. As such these human rulers are seen as the heavenly representative on Earth; carrying out their lord's will from day to day. \nThese regimes can span all religions, and often do, ranging from the Islamic Emirates in the Middle East to Christian Centered groups in Europe and South America. \nRegardless these regimes are ultimately tied to the will of their god; and as such, their population is as well."

Transhumanists study the potential benefits and dangers of new technologies that may overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies. Some transhumanists believe that humans may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with capabilities so greatly extended from the status quo that they deserve the label posthuman. Transhumanists pander to these philosophical and ethical ideas with the aim of creating transhumanists."
