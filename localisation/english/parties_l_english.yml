 totalitarian_socialism_noun:0 "Totalitarian Socialism"
 totalitarian_socialism_desc:0 "Totalitarian Regime"
 totalitarian_socialism_ideology:0 "Totalitarian Socialism"
 totalitarian_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "Totalitarian Socialism refers to a grouping of loosely connected extremely radical socialist ideologies, which employ hyper-militarization as well as direct state control of all assets. \nPopularized in leftist camps after the defeat of the Soviet Union, early totalists believed that the socialist world did not go far enough in preparing for the inevitable conflict with Germany, as well as preparing for global revolution. As such, they called for complete collectivization and the preparation of the state to spread its influence and subsequent idealogy in the name of the liberation of the proletariat. \nTotalitarian Socialist regimes employ various methods to not only consolidate their power but to keep their citizen's lives entirely surveyed and controlled. These range from expansive police and surveillance forces, to elaborate propaganda campaigns; which in turn means that internal dissent is almost entirely non-existent. \nTotalitarian Socialists are now concentrated in Russia, as well as German-dominated Europe, with smaller movements present in South East Asia and the Middle East. These regimes now call for the complete eradication of the anti-revolutionary states across the globe; and their replacement with a suitable government."
 maoism_ideology:0 "Maoism"
 maoism_ideology_desc:0 "Unlike Mao Thought, which is confined to East Asia, Maoism is an ideology found throughout the world. Named after the Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, it is an ideology based on his writings and positions him as the greatest Marxist theorist after Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.\nIt relies on the doctrines of internationalism and anti-imperialism, but differs from traditional Bolshevism in its emphasis on the rural people rather than the urban proletariat. It considers guerrilla warfare in the form of 'long-term people's war' to be the best way of revolutionary struggle in the fight against capitalist rule in places where rural traditions remain.\nMaoism is the natural inheritor of Marxist thought and is considered by its supporters to be the next stage of Bolshevism. Its fundamental anti-imperialist principles have been adopted throughout the world and oppressed people of all kinds are beginning to take up arms against their own oppressors. This new revolutionary departure from traditional Marxist thought is beginning to leave its mark on world history."
#Radical Socialism
 radical_socialism:0 "Radical Socialism"
 radical_socialism_noun:0 "Radical Socialism"
 radical_socialism_desc:0 "Progressive Regime"
 radical_socialism_ideology:0 "Radical Socialism"
 radical_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "Radical Socialism refers to socialist teachings that seek to completely eradicate and dismantle capitalist and colonialist structures, through direct revolution and the radicalization of the masses. \nThese states seek to control the means of production, exchange, and regulation; as opposed to letting any of the private sectors take control over it. As such, these states have elaborate welfare systems and are ultimately classless; providing equal opportunity for all citizens. \nThe end goal of these states is to safeguard the ongoing revolution, while ultimately achieving peak social and economic equality."
 anarcho_communism_ideology:0 "Anarcho-Communism"
 anarcho_communism_ideology_desc:0 "Anarcho-Communism is a diverse body politic that usually seeks the total or partial erosion of the state. It seeks to organise society by other means, through voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups. Such socialists are often regarded by the mainstream left as traitors to the revolution. Anarcho-Communists, while seeking communist institutions, have no wider state structures, pursue complete egalitarianism, equality and freedom from all gods and masters, and reject all or most authoritative positions."
 pan_africanism_ideology:0 "Pan-Africanism"
 pan_africanism_ideology_desc:0 "Pan-Africanism is a product of European oppression. Proponents of this ideology reject individual African states, be they socialist or whatever, and instead preach that Africa must unite under one flag to truly stand up against European colonisers. Pan-Africanism, which falls on the left end of the political spectrum, can be easily distinguished from its one half, African socialism, by its avant-garde stance, including its emphasis on anti-imperialism and its stubborn adherence to a pan-national identity that Europe once called the 'Dark Continent'.\nIts supporters are found mainly in East and West Africa, but its ideas have penetrated from Cape Town to Cairo, and even into black communities in the USA and the Caribbean. Anyone with an interest in the region should keep an eye out for Pan-Africanists who are motivated, angry and actively seeking to expand their influence."
#Moderate Socialism

 moderate_socialism_noun:0 "Moderate Socialism"
 moderate_socialism_desc:0 "Progressive Regime"
 moderate_socialism_ideology:0 "Moderate Socialism"
 moderate_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "Moderate Socialism refers to governments that still seek to work within a democratic framework while simultaneously implementing socialism. \nThese governments seek to bring democratic measures into every way of life while using existing capitalist structures to help along the path. These socialists oppose any backslide towards a one-party state, instead favoring a democratic approach to any pressing issue. \nWhile many see socialism as the long-term goal, some are simply concerned with the excesses of capitalism; as well as current progressive issues. As such these governments insist on industrial democracy and the gradual phasing out of capitalist structures in favor of socialist ones."
 syndicalism_ideology:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_ideology_desc:0 "Socialism in short is the ownership of the means of production by the workers, either directly or through the state. In this respect, there is no purer socialism than Syndicalism, the idea that workers seize control of society and the economy from the capitalist class through the revolutionary action of a general strike and build a new society on the basis of trade unions made up directly from the workers themselves, without intermediaries.\nSyndicalism advocates direct action against the capitalist system, such as strikes, obstruction of production, demonstrations, etc., to improve the conditions of workers living under capitalism and ultimately to overthrow it altogether by replacing it."
#Social Democracy
 social_democracy:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_noun:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_desc:0 "Democrat Regime"
 social_democracy_ideology:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "Social Democracy refers to governments that seek to peacefully implement socialist ideals alongside capitalist ones in favor of creating a supervised free market that is beneficial to the general public as opposed to the select few. \nIt is characterized as having large support for welfare systems, minority groups, as well as unions, and other labor organizations. While retaining socialism as a long-term goal, social democracy is distinguished from some modern forms of democratic socialism for seeking to humanize capitalism and create the conditions for it to lead to greater democratic, egalitarian, and solidaristic outcomes. \nAs such, Social Democracy works with other centrists to ensure it’s legislation is passed in a reasonable manner that appeases both sides of the aisle. As such it has seen traction in the free world, most notably the ruling CCF in Canada."
 leftist_patriotism_ideology:0 "Leftist Patriotism"
 leftist_patriotism_ideology_desc:0 "Colonising land, people and countries is the worst crime of all in that it denies the rights that should be there. The people are reduced to ashes, deprived of their future, undermined by the invaders and the social system is completely destroyed. Countries that have fallen into this situation can be found all over the world. The denunciation of cruel colonialism, that is leftist patriotism. This is a positive assessment of colonisation, unlike the nationalism created by the victors. The reason is that colonisation allows people to experience a common revolutionary struggle, which in turn can be a factor contributing to national unity. Leftist patriotism does not speak of the superiority of their own people and culture, but advocates that they should unite to defeat the invaders. Leftist patriotism continues to fight for the realisation of socialism."
 peoples_front_ideology:0 "People's Front"
 peoples_front_ideology_desc:0 "Embracing an extremely broad range of leftist ideologies, the People's Front can attract support from everyone from hardcore communists with a natural insurrectionist streak to democratic liberals. In extreme cases, it can even include conservatives, but this is rare. Generally, Popular Fronts are set up when there is a significant change in the status quo or when there is concern about the possibility of such a change, in order for the various camps to temporarily put their differences aside to fight elections, military conflicts and so on.\nThe definition of a popular front is as broad as its internal structure. People's Fronts are set up after minimum conditions are put in place to counter threats. In other cases, when insiders differ in ideology, be it socialist or liberal, they may find common ground in policies and ideas and link this to the unity of the People's Front. The overall strategy can be an agreement to vote in unity with each other, or an agreement to support each other during direct action in the streets, whichever is stronger."
#Liberal Democracy
 liberal_democracy:0 "Liberal Democracy"
 liberal_democracy_noun:0 "Liberal Democracy"
 liberal_democracy_desc:0 "Democrat Regime"
 liberal_democracy_ideology:0 "Liberal Democracy"
 liberal_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "Liberal Democracy refers to governments that seek to address economic and social disparities while also utilizing the free markets to do. Social Liberals tend to hold generally progressive stances on issues pertaining to individual rights but can vary in economic opinion. \nSome conclude that a more conservative approach to spending is more beneficial for the general population, while others' views overlap with those of Social Democracy in their beliefs that the governments should invest in the general welfare of the population, while also intervening in the markets to ensure no unfair practices are involved. \nLiberalisms's popularity among younger and disadvantaged voters has seen it take some of the free world by storm; cementing its place as one of the more dominant political forces in the \nUnited States. Its compatibility with Social Democracy, as well as its ability to work well with less radical Conservatives, have seen it form large coalitions; most notably the Republican - Progressives."
 environmental_liberalism_ideology:0 "Environmental Liberalism"
 environmental_liberalism_ideology_desc:0 "Environmental liberalism is centred on the planet, and environmental protection, and the importance of the earth being passed on to the next generation without damage. Environmental liberalism accepts that the natural world is in flux and does not seek to protect it as it is. However, it aims to minimise the damage humans do to the natural world and to help regenerate damaged areas. Environmental liberalism seeks to combine the institutions and tenets of liberalism, such as equality and individual liberty, with environmental protection to reduce major threats to the environment, such as overconsumption and air pollution."
 liberal_conservatism_ideology:0 "Liberal Conservatism"
 liberal_conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "Self-discipline and a strong will are needed to keep democratic values alive. Liberal Conservatives are those who continue to make such meticulous efforts to keep the torch of freedom lit.\nUnlike pure conservatives, they are tolerant of social change to the extent that it can be adjusted and controlled by the powers of the moment, and will take positions when necessary for the sake of governance. Although generally in favour of free market capitalism, individual practitioners may differ on state intervention in the economy to benefit society and curb corporate power. It remains uncertain whether these moderates will survive in the remaining 20th century of absolute violence and totalitarianism."
 longism_ideology:0 "Longism"
 longism_ideology_desc:0 "This ideology, based on Russell Long's policies and personality, is as ambiguous as its name suggests. It espouses civic nationalism, deep piety, and leftist populist economics, while ignoring important issues such as race. Characterized by an authoritarian approach to governing, the Longism regime will do anything for the people, even if the people do not necessarily agree."
 market_liberalism_ideology:0 "Market Liberalism"
 market_liberalism_ideology_desc:0 "The main content of market liberalism is an unregulated free market and a democratic, moneyed political system. They believe that freer markets make people freer, and they also seek to staunchly defend the political and economic rights of individuals."
 neo_liberalism_ideology:0 "Neo Liberalism"
 neo_liberalism_ideology_desc:0 "Neo liberalism is a political system that represents the political re-emergence of 19th century ideas associated with free market capitalism. It is the spark for the rise of conservative and libertarian organisations, parties and intellectuals, and is mainly advocated by them. It is generally associated with economic liberalisation policies such as privatisation, deregulation, globalisation, free trade, monetarism, austerity and reductions in government spending to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society. The characteristics of neo liberalism, both in ideology and practice, have been the subject of much scholarly debate. \nAs an economic idea, neo liberalism emerged among European liberals in the 1930s. They saw the central ideas of classical liberalism decline in popularity after the First Great Depression, driven by a desire to manipulate markets, and sought to revive and evolve, creating improved policies to counter free market fluctuations and mitigate their negative social effects. One driver of policy formulation to mitigate free market fluctuations was the desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, with the failures sometimes attributed primarily to classical liberal economic policies."
 social_liberalism_ideology:0 "Social Liberalism"
 social_liberalism_ideology_desc:0 "With a long philosophical tradition of valuing personal liberty, liberalism views safeguarding these rights as the primary function of the state."
#Social Conservatism
 social_conservatism:0 "Social Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_noun:0 "Social Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_desc:0 "Democrat Regime"
 social_conservatism_ideology:0 "Social Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "Social Conservatism refers to governments that seek to retain traditional structures and practices, as opposed to reforming. As such, these governments are typically extremely pro-capitalist, as well as enforcing the social standards considered the “norm”. \nSeeking to capitalize on the free market potential to bring equality to its citizens, and rather than attempting to change the domestic situation of individuals, these governments focus on preserving the institutions of the time; as well as guaranteeing domestic stability. \nThis means these governments are inherently pro-tradition, pro-hierarchy, and pro-realism; anything that sits outside this definition is generally considered on the other side of conservatism. It should be noted however that various camps of conservatism exist; ranging from Paternalists who seek to improve the situation of their countrymen through more conservative means, to \nNeo-Conservatives who attempt to bring direct force against the enemies they are faced with; in an attempt to prevent the ousting of their traditions."
 fiscal_conservatism_ideology:0 "Fiscal Conservatism"
 fiscal_conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "Fiscal conservatism is an ideology that seeks to be prudent in government spending and debt while maintaining conservative politics. The principles of capitalism, limited government and laissez-faire form its ideological basis. Fiscal conservatives advocate avoiding deficit financing, cutting taxes and reducing overall government spending and national debt while balancing the budget balance. In other words, fiscal conservatives oppose the expansion of government beyond its means through debt, but usually choose debt over tax increases. They are strong believers in libertarian principles such as individualism and free enterprise, and often advocate deregulation, privatisation and free trade."
 neo_conservatism_ideology:0 "Neo Conservatism"
 neo_conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "Neo conservatism is a political ideology, which emphasises liberalism and democracy, prioritises ideas and ideals over national and practical interests, and does not resort to armed intervention. \nThere were not always common interests among organisations and individuals adopting conservative positions. In particular, traditionalism and libertarianism often conflict. For example, the emphasis on the Christian spirit caused political conflicts between traditionalists and Christian fundamentalists and libertarianism, which advocates total free competition. However, it is a mistake to assume that they necessarily have violent disagreements, as evidenced by the fact that figures who adhere to libertarianism agree with Christian opposition to abortion and homosexuals. \nIn addition, the non-interventionism of traditionalists and libertarianism, which does not pay serious attention to foreign and security policy, caused a very serious political conflict with the active interventionism of the anti-communists."
 silent_conservatism_ideology:0 "Silent Conservatism"
 silent_conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "This conservative ideology is so moderate that its equivalent leaders refer to their own supporters and backers as the "silent majority" and the "voice of the voiceless. The idea is based on the idea that "most of the people have moderate views and are not strongly opinionated, so we should listen carefully to their voices." The foundation of this concept is based on mutual trust between the leaders and the people."
#Authoritarian Democracy

 authoritarian_democracy_noun:0 "Authoritarian Democracy"
 authoritarian_democracy_desc:0 "Authoritarian Regime"
 authoritarian_democracy_ideology:0 "Authoritarian Democracy"
 authoritarian_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "Authoritarian Democracy or Totalitarian Democracy refers to democratically elected regimes that resort to authoritarian means to ensure their rule. It is most typically directed by the ruling class in an attempt to “represent” the different interests of society. \nAs such it often directly contradicts democracy; sometimes excluding voters from the picture at all in favor of the “educated” and party loyal. \nThis also refers to states in which one party is so dominant, whether through legitimate or illegitimate means, that the attempts of any other party to take power are completely squashed. As such these parties have a complete hold over the political sphere and have total say in how it is shaped. These regimes tend to be both anti-capitalist and anti-socialist; instead favoring a corporatist approach to economics. This also means that in many instances these governments have fascist or quasi-fascist sympathies; leading to a rivalry with nearly every other involved party."
 dixiecrat_democracy_ideology:0 "Dixiecrat Democracy"
 dixiecrat_democracy_ideology_desc:0 "The Dixiecrat democracy were supported primarily in the U.S. South and initially arose due to regional divisions in the South that opposed the Democratic Party. The establishment was organized as a breakaway faction by many conservative white politicians in the South who opposed the civil rights movement. The Dixiecrats wanted to protect the rights of Southern states to maintain racial segregation, while the party opposed racial integration and wanted to maintain racism and white supremacy in the face of possible federal intervention."
 national_conservatism_ideology:0 "National Conservatism"
 national_conservatism_ideology_desc:0 "Strong and united states are the ones who have the best chance of winning on the world stage. Those who seek to recreate the victories of the Axis must also recreate their rigorous national consciousness. This is the starting point of National Conservatism.\nNational Conservatives, the right-wing ideal, believe that national unity takes precedence over all other social goals and that unity is maintained by safeguarding the unique traditions of the nation. The state becomes an institution for strengthening national unity. Many National Conservatives support laissez-faire economic policies, while others believe that the state should provide for the people in a paternalistic capacity. Many National Conservatives emphasise the differences between their own ideology and fascist ideology, but many are willing to cooperate with fascists if their goals are aligned."
 social_nationalism_ideology:0 "Social Nationalism"
 social_nationalism_ideology_desc:0 "The colonisation of land, people and the country itself in imperialism is nothing less than the denial of the rights that should be there. The people become shells deprived of a future, devoured by the invaders, and the normal social structures cease to function. Countries that have fallen into this situation can be found all over the world. These are the crimes committed by Americans and Europeans in Africa and Oceania, and by the Japanese in Asia.\nBut all crimes will eventually be punished. The denunciation of cruel colonialism is the theory of Social Nationalism. It differs from the nationalism that emerged in Germany and Japan in that it positively evaluates colonisation. The reason is that colonisation allows people to experience a common struggle and can in fact be a factor contributing to national unity. Social Nationalists do not speak of the superiority of their own people and culture, but advocate unity and the defeat of oppressors. Social Nationalism will use any economic system to achieve its goals, but in most cases it is fighting for the realisation of some kind of socialism."

 paternal_autocracy_ideology:0 "Paternal Autocracy"
 paternal_autocracy_ideology_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy refers to a state of government in which power is concentrated in the hands of a single power, therefore meaning the restraints found in other systems of government are virtually nonexistent. This means a single individual is responsible for all actions of the nation, while also possibly having advisors or a council. \nWhile this generally applies to monarchies, this is not always the case; it also can apply to military juntas or other forms of civil dictatorships. \nThese governments are also not inherently right or left-wing either; simply led by a single person who has supreme power over all."

 national_corporatism_ideology_desc:0 "National Corporatism, originally finding its ground in Italy before the Second World War, refers to a regime that is characterized by a dictatorial leader, extreme militarism, autocracy, belief in a central hierarchy, and the implementation of corporatism on the national level. \nNational Corporatist regimes employ several methods to hold power, most notably their direct opposition and attacks on freedom of speech and democracy. On top of this, national corporatist regimes also directly oppose anarchism, liberalism, communism, and other forms of socialism. This means national corporatist regimes attempt to create a society where they, and only they, are the viable leader of the state. \nNational corporatist regimes believe that democracy and capitalism are obsolete, and as such must be replaced with more state-controlled methods, with the end goal of achieving complete economic autarky."

 national_socialism_ideology:0 "National Socialism"
 national_socialism_ideology_desc:0 "National Socialism, the prevalent idealogy in Nazi-occupied Europe, refers to a system of government, that like fascism is characterized by a dictatorial leader, extreme militarism, autocracy, belief in a central hierarchy, and the implementation of corporatism on the national level. \nIn the German strain of National Socialism, the ultimate goal is to achieve lebensraum for the Aryan Race, while simultaneously wiping out the threats to said race; including liberals, homosexuals, Jews, and communists. This would naturally mean Europe is wholly German. However, variants of the idealogy exist, most notably in the other countries that fought alongside \nGermany in the 2nd World War. Ultimately all their policies are the same; attempting to eradicate outside threats with extreme violence and prejudice, and secure a homeland for their people."

 ultra_nationalism_ideology:0 "Ultra Nationalism"
 ultra_nationalism_ideology_desc:0 "Characterized by extreme jingoism, Ultranationalist regimes seek to completely assert national supremacy through any means necessary. These involve completely preparing the state for what is perceived as an inevitable war, the indoctrination of the general public, an extreme aversion to outside influence and cooperation, and the attempt to ensure the nation's culture rise not only above its neighbors, but the globe as well. \nThese regimes usually gain traction in nations that have been defeated in a large-scale conflict that has seen the almost complete destruction of their nation or their way of life. Using the population's desire for vengeance, these regimes are able to conscript thousands, if not millions of indoctrinated soldiers ready to reclaim their nation's lost glory; or die trying."

 religious_nationalism_ideology_desc:0 "Theocracy is characterized as a system of governance that has a religious basis, or claims divine deities are giving guidance to the human rulers. As such these human rulers are seen as the heavenly representative on Earth; carrying out their lord's will from day to day. \nThese regimes can span all religions, and often do, ranging from the Islamic Emirates in the Middle East to Christian Centered groups in Europe and South America. \nRegardless these regimes are ultimately tied to the will of their god; and as such, their population is as well."

 eurasianism_ideology_desc:0 "Eurasianism is defined in relation to the proposal of a Eurasian super-nation as a social concept that the peoples of Eurasia, from the Carpathian Mountains to the Mongolian steppes, must be integrated into a single social and political group in order to increase national strength and protect against destructive external influences. It is then through preparation and implementation that the passions of the peoples are maximised and social feats are achieved. This approach extends to forcibly integrating Eurasian countries into a single framework in order to realise the doctrine of cultural integration."

Transhumanists study the potential benefits and dangers of new technologies that may overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies. Some transhumanists believe that humans may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with capabilities so greatly extended from the status quo that they deserve the label posthuman. Transhumanists pander to these philosophical and ethical ideas with the aim of creating transhumanists."
