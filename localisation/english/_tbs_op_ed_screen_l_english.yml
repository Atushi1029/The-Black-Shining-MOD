The kōdō-ha staged a coup d'etat.\nThe control faction, the Emperor's entourage and the politicians who were at the heart of the military at the time did not anticipate a victory for the kōdō-ha. Those predictions were easily betrayed and His Majesty showed mercy towards them. The young officers managed to pull off the coup d'etat on the sole condition that no further futile killing would take place.\n\nA few days later, a military cabinet of the kōdō-ha faction was formed, led by Jinzaburō Masaki. This cabinet's main achievements were the expulsion of the tōsei-ha, the suppression of socialists and the start of the Sino-Japanese War.\nThe Sino-Japanese war was fierce. President John N. Garner, who dominated the US at the time, was a right-wing politician with an anti-communist and anti-Soviet motto, and his declaration of war on the Republic of China, which was regarded as a pawn of the Soviet Union, was worthy of US support. Having won the support of the US, the Japanese occupied Beijing and Nanking in a short time, and after Chiang Kai-shek withdrew to Chongqing, a pitched battle ensued.\n\nAs time went on, in March 1939, Masaki's cabinet, which had been frustrated even from within the same Imperialist faction, was dissolved and Sadao Araki was appointed as the new Prime Minister. Predicting that the existing cabinet would weaken the kōdō-ha, Araki called on influential political figures such as Fumimaro Konoe and Fusanosuke Kuhara to form a united cabinet.\nIn 1942, Germany was fighting a good war against the Soviet Union, which led to the implementation of the initial 'northward expansionism' and the declaration of war against the Soviet Union. The cold in the Far East and Siberia was a detriment to the Japanese forces, but the US Revised Lend-Lease Act, the advance into Indochina, mainly by naval and reserve forces, and the fall of Britain in 1943 favoured the Soviet invasion by Japan and Germany, and the Soviet Union collapsed in 1944.\n\nThe Peace Conference of 1945 succeeded in making Malaysia, Burma, India, the Indochinese countries and Indonesia independent, and these countries, together with Siam, joined the Daitōa Kyōeiken.\nMeanwhile, domestically, Konoe took over the real leadership and, following Araki's death from illness in 1947, took over power; in June 1949, he brought the ROC to its complete knees, and in October 1949, the new nationalist regime that Konoe had planned, and the political party to implement it, the 'Taisei Yokusankai' was established. Through the mediation of Kuhara, the newly powerful Shigeru Yoshida, Ichirō Hatoyama and Inejirō Asanuma, the largest combined party from the Rikken Seiyūkai to the Shakai Taishū-to was completed, and the Yokusankai gained supremacy.\n\nThe fall of Konoe's hegemony came in May 1953, when Hotsumi Ozaki, then chief cabinet secretary, was discovered to be a spy for the Soviet Union and, after its collapse, the US Communist Party. Ozaki was swiftly executed and the Konoe cabinet collapsed accordingly.\nHis successor, Shigeru Yoshida, worked on relaxing the long-neglected wartime constitution and other laws. Yoshida, who is often referred to as the 'father of Japanese democracy', continued to crack down on communists, while at the same time promoting the electoral system, bureaucracy, legislation and infrastructure with the aim of creating a modern democratic state.\n\nIn 1958, the 2nd Great Depression broke out, mainly in the USA, and the Yoshida administration collapsed due to a lack of response. Hayato Ikeda, a former finance bureaucrat, and Nobusuke Kishi, a former commerce and industry bureaucrat, set up a new regime based on Japanese-style national socialism and established a new faction within the Yokusankai, the Kokumin Dōshikai, which quickly gained support. With Ikeda as the new Prime Minister, Japan was supposed to have made a new start, but this ended in failure. And that was the time to deal with the rebellious Republic of China, and the Empire of Japan was knocked into a corner. The ROC, which had secured military support from the US and Italy, had caused the Japanese forces great hardship. India, Burma and Siam, which had long planned to break away from Japan's economic domination, gave up on Japan, Laos fell to Siam and Japan lost many of its allies. Finally, after six years of fighting, the independence of the Republic of China was recognised, and the result pushed Japan further than ever before.\n\nAfter the peace conference, the dissatisfaction of the people with the Kokumin Dōshikai, led by then Prime Minister Shōjirō Kawashima, and the military, which had been defeated at great cost, quickly turned public opinion to the left.\nSocialist theorists, who had long been in hiding, woke up and established the 'Shakai Kakushin Dōmei' within the Yokusankai.\nAs the reigning leader of the faction, Kei Hoashi succeeded in sweeping the Yokusankai during the 1967 Yokusan elections and became the Empire's first socialist Prime Minister. His first task was to deal with the Philippines and Vietnam, traitors who had taken advantage of China. He overran the Philippines with massive military operations and manoeuvre warfare, and dropped two atomic bombs on Vietnam to test a new type of weapon. The dropping of the world's first nuclear weapons drew condemnation from liberal countries, particularly the US and Italy, but he was unperturbed.\nAfter the suppression, he succeeded in stabilising the situation in the country to some extent by carrying out major socialist and workers-oriented reforms."
