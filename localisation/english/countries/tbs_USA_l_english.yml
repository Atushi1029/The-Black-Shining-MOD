#National Sprits
 USA_a_quiet_pacific:0 "A Quiet Pacific"
 USA_a_quiet_pacific_desc:0 "There was a time where it was feared that the war in the Pacific would come to the shores of America, dragging the United States into the conflict that ravaged China for years, and turned the United Kingdom and France from colonial powers into humiliated, puppet states.\n\nBut America knew peace on its western coast.\n\nJapan and the United States have consistently reached agreements in the areas of trade, military matters, and diplomacy. Cultural exchanges between the two states are uncommon, but not unheard of. Japanese electronics are popular in the American markets, as Ford and Chevrolet trucks speed through Tokyo. An understanding between the two powers has been reached, as neither side wishes for another destructive war. There is a unspoken acknowledgement between Tokyo and Washington:\n\nFor Now!"
 USA_bastion_of_liberty:0 "Bastion of Liberty"
 USA_bastion_of_liberty_desc:0 "As the Hinomaru was raised over Nanking, and the Swastika cast over Paris, many questioned the position of the United States in the new world. Isolationist sentiment only grew after the defeat of the Allies and Soviets, and the aftershocks of the Great Depression amplified feelings of dissent and disdain.\n\nBut as time went on, Americas own interests came into the cross-hairs. The Rising Sun grew ever larger, gobbling up what was left of the once mighty European empires in Asia, stopping just short of Australia due to American aid. The Germans progressively grew their extermination campaigns throughout Europe, and brought their horrors to Africa and the former USSR. \n\nTimes have changed since then; but the reality is still the same. Japan still holds almost all of Asia, and Germany's iron claw grips the people of Europe; with no intention of letting go anytime soon.\n\nAmerica will ensure this fate does not befall its people or it's allies. America will remain free, and the world shall know true liberty some day soon.\n\nBut democracy is a fickle thing, and sometimes the right ideas end up with the wrong people executing them."
 USA_the_johnson_doctrine:0 "The Johnson Doctrine"
 USA_the_johnson_doctrine_desc:0 "Formulated in 1966 by the Johnson Administration after the Atlantic Incidents, the Johnson Doctrine is the main driving foreign policy idea in the United States. \n\nCalling for arming any group opposed to the former Axis powers, the Doctrine helps provides intelligence, weapons, training and in some instances American advisors to groups friendly to the US interests.\n\nWhile revisions have been made due to the warming of American-Japanese relations, the Doctrine still supports various Russian partisan groups, and Anti-Colonial forces in both the Italian and German spheres; leading to constant friction between America and the European powers."
 USA_the_soaring_eagle:0 "The Soaring Eagle"
 USA_the_soaring_eagle_desc:0 "The Russian Eagle lies neutered and dying as its cries echo for miles. The once mighty German Eagle tears at the seams, as its over stretched empire and unsustainable system create an environment ripe for corruption and revolution. \n\nThe American Eagle Soars as it looks on at the chaos. It's goods dominate the markets, its movies are seen all around the world, its musicians are among the best known, and its manufacturing creates the best products. \n\nBut the Eagle knows the warning of Icarus rings true; “Fly to close to the sun, and your wings will melt.”\n\nAfter all, isn't flight just a balancing act?"
 USA_untested_dod:0 "Untested DoD"
 USA_untested_dod_desc:0 "While the United States is no stranger to war, it remains untested in the modern era. Barring minor interventions in the Cold War with Germany and Japan, the United States has not fought any war since World War One; a time where horses still dragged soldiers to and from.\n\nAmerica has kept up with its competitors in the development of weapons and doctrines; but the relative unpreparedness and nonchalant attitude of the DoD has left some to wonder if the United States is ready for the next major conflict."
