 JAP_chifuyu_masaki_for_desc:0 "§Y$tbs_foreign_minister$\n$tbs_great_compromiser$\n§!Chifuyu Masaki had been a believer in socialism since he was a junior high school student and was repeatedly arrested for participating in the labour movement; he did not abandon these thoughts even after joining the Kikaku-in in 1935 and falling prey to the Chian-Iji hō in 1941, rather than continuing his activities. He surprisingly declared a turn to the rightist, even though the repression of socialists in the country had become even stronger since the Hotsumi Ozaki incident in 1954. When he learnt of Japan's defeat, he immediately founded a leftist faction of Yokusankai together with Kei Hoashi and others, and now holds an important post. He is said to be pursuing the whereabouts of Sanzō Nosaka and Kenji Miyamoto, who were once under his care but were expelled due to oppression."

He was such a big figure that he cut off a policeman's arm with a Nihontō during the Ani-Maedamura Kosaku-sōgi, and a few years later was arrested in the Jinmin-sensen Jiken, and furthermore, during the war, under the Chian-Iji hō. After the war, he often took part in the labour movement and ran a bar in Tokyo, but lost his job during the 2nd Great Depression and was in rough shape when he met someone who changed his life. That man was the reformist heretic Kakuei Tanaka. He entrusted Ogasawara to the reformist chieftain at the time, Komakichi Matsuoka. Under Matsuoka, Ogasawara studied politics desperately and within just a few years became a major figure in wingnut politics. As soon as Japan was defeated and a leftist faction was founded by Kei Hoashi, he immediately joined it and now held a senior post in the government."

Exposed to Marxism in high school, he went on to Kyōto Teikoku Daigaku and then to the Naikaku Chōsa-kyoku, where he met Hiroo Wada. He eventually became an investigator for the Kikaku-in, and when he was arrested in 1941 for the Kikaku-in-Jiken, he spent the rest of his life in seclusion after his release. He thought he was going to end his life as it was, but it seems that fate was cruel. When Japan was defeated by China, Kei Hoashi went to the homes of former labour activists, communists and reform bureaucrats to found a leftist faction. While many refused due to old age, Seiichi Katsumata saw it as a great opportunity and agreed, and with the two of them as the initial members, the Taisei Yokusankai created the Leftist Faction."

It was not until the 2nd Great Depression that he turned completely red. The first thing that crossed his mind when he saw the Depression was... nothing else but his own student days studying Marxism. Since then, he has relearnt Marxian economics and joined the leftist faction founded by Kei Hoashi, and since then has studied geopolitics and defence techniques, and has now risen to head the Bōei-shō."

 POLITICS_KEI_HOASHI_DESC:0 "Kei Hoashi, he is such a genius that he seems to have been born with it all. Born in Ōita-ken, he threw himself into the student movement while studying at Tōkyō teikoku Daigaku and remained a staunch believer in socialism even after becoming a member of the Shōkō-shō. He espoused not only Marxism but even Nazism, and could be said to be Japan's greatest lover of socialism. After the end of WWII, he approached the conservative radicalist faction led by Nobusuke Kishi and acted as a brain of the rightists. However, when Japan was defeated by China, he founded a leftist faction as if he remembered his former mission, and won the 1968 yokusan election by a wide margin over the existing faction. In just four years, he succeeded in restoring Japan to a certain degree, using his brains, his skills and his knowledge of socialism. However, the military and ultra nationalists were wary of him. Rumours were circulating that they were working day by day to condemn Kei Hoashi to hell, and kei Hoashi himself could not afford to be complacent."

 tbs_jap.0.desc:0 ""Happy New Year. Katsumata."\n\n"No, no, it's the same to you, and I look forward to working with you this year. Hoashi."\n\nThe rulers of the Empire of Japan, Kei Hoashi and Seiichi Katsumata, are walking towards the Diet, chatting and laughing together with their colleagues. The events of the New Year's holiday, a moment with their families, returning to their parents' homes - topics that would have been unthinkable in Japan 20 years ago.\n\nOn New Year's Day this year, it snowed heavily and it was freezing outside, said to be the biggest cold snap in a decade.\n\nA few minutes after entering Parliament, members of other factions began to trickle in. Everyone is chatting and laughing, everyone is full of smiles.\n\n"I'm glad. The Japan where everyone can smile is getting closer to our hands..." Hoashi was deeply moved.\n\n"...have you heard, Hoashi?'\n\n"Oh, I'm sorry, Asukata. By the way, do you have this year's budget proposal ready?"\n\n"Yes, of course. I'm relieved that it's the usual disarmament plan. Even though relations with the US and China have deteriorated recently, nuclear armaments and military build-up are an affront to peace."\n\n"Yes, that's exactly right. But maybe the time will come when we will have to reverse this plan. If that time comes, don't blame us."\n\n"I'm well aware of that."\n\nA few minutes later, the opening ceremony of this year's Parliament began."

Originally an economist, he has, by a twist of fate, turned socialist and, on the contrary, has been appointed Minister of Defence, a position with which he would have had the most unlikely of connections.\n\n"...I would like to put together such a defence plan in a bill and submit it to you... how would you like it?"\n\n"Oh. Interesting. But there are one or two problems here..."\n\n"Thank you, Ninagawa. I'll submit it with these amendments."\n\n"Yes. By the way, the other day about the control officers... is that true?"\n\n"Yes, I have my secretary and the prosecutors investigating the matter over there, but I have no doubt that the militarists of the Tōsei-ha are plotting Ninagawa's murder."\n\n"I see, I see, Hoashi. Perhaps they need to be sanctioned again."\n\n"Yes, I think we'll leave you alone now. Ninagawa."\n\nHoashi left Ninagawa's office. Pushing through the corridor, which was silent for a while, a scowling smile appeared on Hoashi's face. He is no longer a man, a wolf-boy would be an appropriate metaphor."

Mr Johnson, I too am honoured to meet you and your colleagues..."\n\nHoashi's slick but awkward English is always the product of a trembling mind and a frightening air of pretence.\n\n"What's the matter with your grim face? Even we in the US have sworn that we will not make any demands that are detrimental to Japan."\n\n"Yes, that's all well and good, but... I'm confused by my first summit meeting. My English may not be very good, but I hope you can understand me."\n\n"Oh, I understand, my Japanese friends. Now, to cut to the chase, would it be possible for you to consider withdrawing our troops from the Philippines and Vietnam?"\n\n"Yes. But in that case, we would also like you to take our demands... We would be grateful if you would consider withdrawing the US troops in China and removing the missile bases."\n\n"I see..."\n\nJohnson, and Hoashi himself, knew this. From the very beginning, this liaison meeting was not going to go well, and would forever lead to parallel lines..."

 tbs_jap.3.desc:0 ""That's what happened, that's why our Shakai Kakushin Dōmei had a hard time."\n\n"Oh, I didn't know that happened. I heard that being Minister of Finance is not easy."\n\nThe two men chatting in the bar are Ichio Asukata, Minister of Finance of the Imperial Japanese Empire, and Kiichi Miyazawa, a member of the Kentetsukai, who was supposed to be his adversary. The two had been friends since their days at the Ministry of Finance. Both Asukata and Miyazawa were originally bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance, but entered politics after the Chinese Rebellion. Asukata was a little late to the Ministry, but he was one of those who made a name for himself as an kakushin kanryō, making use of his natural talents. Miyazawa respects this man, Asukata. Even if the factions he belonged to were completely different, even if they had different ideologies, even if they had different educational backgrounds, he respected him for putting aside his own arrogant viewpoints.\n\nAsukata is an interesting man. The legal profession he once aspired to was not something he was suited for, even if it interested him. Based on advice from Suehiro Nishio and Inejirō Asanuma, then heads of the Leftists, and Okinori Kaya, the chief Minister of Finance, he set his sights on becoming a finance bureaucrat, one way or another. He passed with flying colours and was classified as a heretic even within his own party because of his natural talent and innovative position. Decades later, he has risen to the top of the Ministry of Finance. He is no longer a heretic, but has gained the position of deciding heresy."

 tbs_jap.5.title:0 "Existence of the East-Asian Special Administrative Region"
 tbs_jap.5.desc:0 "The East Asian Special Administrative Region of the Japanese Imperial Dominions, commonly known as the 'Tōa Gyōsei-ku', is an interesting entity.\n\nAfter the end of the WW2 and the success of the firebombing, Japan acquired some South East Asian colonies and established a federation of special administrative regions centred on Shōnan Island and the Chinese Concession. It could be said that this was a place to experiment with a market capitalist economy and liberal democratic system under the influence of the Empire of Japan. Unlike the harsh rule of the home country, this region, where freedom was tolerated, was an ideal place for many citizens.\n\nThe Imperial Navy, which was establishing its corporate brand, the South Manchurian Railway, which was reformed after the Harbin Incident, start-up companies pursuing their ambitions, and the 15 major conglomerates aiming for colonial factories, all set foot in Shōnan, China, Ceylon and Magadan in pursuit of their own ambitions and interests.\n\nHowever, behind these shadows lies a point of concern. In those areas where freedom and money are at stake, there are underground socialist movements, and rumour has it that Soviet spies from the Asano brigade are active as arms dealers. Kakushin Kanryōs from the Mantetsu Chōsa-bu, the Kikaku-in and the Foreign Ministry, who were supposed to have been crushed in the Harbin Incident, may be plotting to regain power in the land to which they were transferred.\n\nAnother concern is the companies and influential people based there. They may become big and eventually turn on us.\n\nWe need to keep an eye on them and be prepared to follow in the footsteps of Vietnam and the Philippines in some cases."

So..."\n\nMōri was reminiscing: in May 1953, Mōri had lost everything in the Harbin Incident, a series of arrests by the Mantesu Chōsa-bu and the Kikau-in that took place in Harbin and other places in the Communist bloc. Due to the treachery of Nobuhiko Ushiba and Hisatsune Sakomizu, Mōri had his entire past dredged up and was sent to the Sugamo Prison together with Yōji Minobe. Even after his release from prison, it was hell. He was seen as a communist spy by the political world and his fellow bureaucrats, and even now, after being appointed president of the Kikaku-in through the mediation of Hoashi and others, he is still regarded as the worst kind of communist by the younger right bureaucrats.\n\nIn fact, even those I am now calling would not trust me. Is there no longer any future for socialists, including me? With young politicians, intellectuals and businessmen leaving the left, the hegemony of the Shakai Kakushin Dōmei may not last long.\n\n"That's all I have to say, Mōri. Then I will contact you again later."\n\n"Ah, sorry about that."\n\nWas this really the right thing to do...?"

 tbs_jap.7.desc:0 ""Oh, Hoashi. Please sit down."\n\n"Thank you, Mr Gins."\n\n"No, no, our Far East Siberia is developing thanks to you... and in recent years the people are so active that they surpass not only the Soviets but even the former empire."\n\n"Oh, I see. In recent years, Japan has begun to develop Siberian resources, so friendship with Far East Siberia is essential for Japanese companies."\n\n"Oh, I'm very happy to hear that. However, I may not have much longer ahead of me. Please take care of my 'idiot sons' after they become president, will you?"\n\n"Yes, understood. By the way, are your sons also politicians, Mr Gins?"\n\n"No, they are like Kolchak and Wrangel, my students. My own sons are not politicians, I let them do what they want freely."\n\n"Oh, I see. Then please give my regards to those 'sons'."\n\nFor Hoashi, President Gins was a man he could trust as a relative uncle. His natural gentleness and his gentle Russian were calming to Hoashi's cold heart.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, Georgy Gins, a minister in the provisional government led by Alexander Kolchak, was forced to flee his country and went into exile in the USA. Decades later, a miracle happened. Japan and Germany crushed the Soviets and a country for White Russians was established in Siberia.\n\nAs Minister of Finance in the White Russian government led by Grigory Semyonov, he remained at the top of Siberian politics and close to the people after Semyonov's death.\n\nHe will no longer live long, and he himself is aware of this. A new era may be coming to Siberia. And only God knows whether it will be good or bad."

 tbs_jap.8.desc:0 ""Welcome to you, Prime Minister Hoashi."\n\nMikhail Ovlov, a youth member of the Russian Fascist Party, witnessed a shocking sight. Alexander Bolotov, the deputy Fascist Party Vozhd, was being reverent to strangers. For the young party members, the presence of Bolotov was fear itself. He used to serve in the White Army, joined the Russian Fascist Party after defecting to Manchuria, continued to assassinate Jews and communists as a secret police, and eventually rose to the Vozhd, albeit by proxy. It is therefore impossible to describe Bolotov, who is proud and immediately expels or purges anyone he doesn't like, except in terms of fear. Such an overbearing man always bows down in front of a single Japanese. The sight of this was not strange to Ovlov.\n\n"By the way, where is our wonderful business partner, Rodzaevsky, in the sickroom?"\n\n"Yes, he's in room 307. He was hit by a car after drinking too much vodka and getting drunk... It's a miracle he's alive."\n\n"That's important, isn't it? I should have brought some grapes from my hometown in Ōita."\n\n"No, no, such a luxury item is too good for him."\n\nBolotov said with a laugh. Ovlov thought about snitching on the matter one day."

We suffered military confrontations and economic turmoil, and quickly lost many colonies. In the end, we were able to make peace using nuclear weapons as a shield, but the result was that our weakened image and cowardly diplomatic methods were exposed to the world. We will never make the same mistake again!"

The country, which from the outset had an active movement to strengthen democracy, has been fully democratised since the defeat, but surprisingly it passed them by and even led to the seizure of power by the socialists, mainly with the support of the workers.

Since then, Kōdō-ha, Tōsei-ha, Manshū-ha and Sakura-kai, both Army and Navy, have shown disturbing behaviour. And the defeat in the Chinese Rebellion and the enforcement of the Army Military Administration against the Vietnam and Philippine insurgencies further aggravated them. If we falter in our fragile democratic politics, they may turn the Katana against us."
