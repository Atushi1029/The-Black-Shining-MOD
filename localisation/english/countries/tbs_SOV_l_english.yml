#Focuses
 tbs_soviet:0 "Soviet Union National Focus"
 SOV_the_old_marshal_and_the_two_heads:0 "The Old Marshal and the Two Heads"
 SOV_the_old_marshal_and_the_two_heads_desc:0 "The Soviet Union is still alive. Even after Marshal Vasilevsky's death, it is still alive in the Northern Urals under Zhukov's high leadership. But the Marshal himself was aware of this. He was becoming old and unable to operate as he had done in the past. \n\nIt is time for him to move on."
 SOV_about_domestic_affairs:0 "About Domestic Affairs"
 SOV_about_domestic_affairs_desc:0 "The struggle for the succession of our Union has begun. One of the most noteworthy details is internal politics. A number of MPs have focused their attention and proposals on the two successors. The Soviet Union has long had a history of political struggles. Of course, there are no doubt many different agendas lurking in this internal political dispute..."
 SOV_about_economy:0 "About Economy"
 SOV_about_economy_desc:0 "The struggle for the succession of our Union has begun. One of the most noteworthy details is the economy. The economy is a matter of life and death for the people. It is also a question of our existence if we do not undermine the ideology of the Federation. However, there are still many demands from the various regions. What choice will the successors really make?"
 SOV_on_the_cult_of_personality_and_its_consequences:0 "On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences"
 SOV_on_the_cult_of_personality_and_its_consequences_desc:0 "We lost the war because of Stalin. Because of Stalion, valuable personnel were lost. Because of Stalin..., because of Stalin! Many party members recognised that his administration of government had led to the present federal situation, and Khrushchev, once a leading figure in the government, made this criticism official. A long time has passed since then. \n\nOne day, a party member published an article in the party's official newspaper. It was natural behaviour to look at the official newspaper, and Suslov followed suit and looked at it."
 SOV_nkvd_debate:0 "NKVD Debate"
 SOV_nkvd_debate_desc:0 "Zhukov has long expressed certain concerns. It is that the NKVD, the security forces, are gaining more strength than before. They already have some real units, and although they are a force to be reckoned with, their organisational size may have become bloated...?"
 SOV_wisdom_given_to_the_ignorant:0 "Wisdom Given to the Ignorant"
 SOV_wisdom_given_to_the_ignorant_desc:0 "The educational knowledge of the peoples of the USSR is low. There is a growing number of ignorant adults and innocent children on the territory, and they should be given the opportunity for education. The problem, however, was 'its content'. The two successors argued vehemently against this."
 SOV_the_list:0 "The List"
 SOV_the_list_desc:0 "A file was sent to Suslov's office. It was labelled 'survey list'. Suslov himself was convinced that it was the result of simple data on the territory's economic situation that he had previously requested. However, Suslov himself was busy with his priorities for this list and, because of the sudden arrival of a visitor, he pushed the list to the side without checking its contents. \n\nHe was then so busy that the contents of the list were forgotten."
 SOV_pros_and_cons_of_a_party_system:0 "Pros and Cons of a Party System"
 SOV_pros_and_cons_of_a_party_system_desc:0 "The traditional federation was almost a dictatorship with a leader at the top, and the council was more of a body that generated endorsement and ideas. This is how the Federation functioned because it was blessed with no small number of leaders. Stalin had established his support base through fear-mongering, Vasilevsky through charisma and Zhukov through competence. \n\nThe two successors, however, did not have the confidence to be like that, at least not themselves. Then something else had to be prepared. The reformist Yeltsin's proposal was to create internal competitors and a constantly tightened council. In other words, multiple parties should be created."
 SOV_the_mates:0 "The Mates"
 SOV_the_mates_desc:0 "Although the reformist Gorbachev has had a problem with a small number of supporters, many people seem to have been impressed by his arguments and debates at the council meetings. Gorbachev's number two, Boris Yeltsin, who is dependable apart from being somewhat too democratic, has taken advantage of this opportunity to successfully steer those from lower class backgrounds towards the reformist camp. There are also increasing spontaneous expressions of support from centrists such as Gumilyov, which should make the struggle for succession even more competitive!"
 SOV_become_tense:0 "Become Tense"
 SOV_become_tense_desc:0 "As the battle for succession progresses, various party members propose agendas, against which Sousslov and Gorbachev's debates have intensified. Even after the council meeting is adjourned, party members talk about their assessments of the debate in their offices, in the canteen and in the corridors. Even if Zhukov does not urge any action, the Council is acting with an eye to the future. \n\nIt seems that the new era is almost upon us..."
 SOV_visit_the_leading_actors_of_the_era:0 "Visit the Leading Actors of the Era"
 SOV_visit_the_leading_actors_of_the_era_desc:0 "With only a few days of leadership left in his life, Zhukov decided to inspect the units in different parts of the country once more to check the situation of the Red Army. \n\nHe began to feel something in his knowledge and intuition."
 SOV_reflecting_on_memories_of:0 "Reflecting on Memories of…"
 SOV_reflecting_on_memories_of_desc:0 "The Red Army was now doing well under limited circumstances, but it was not satisfying for Zhukov. He looked out, remembering the former glory of the Red Army. Tokhachevsky's ideal strategy, the German way of fighting, the Blitzkrieg. And many memories of the many battles he had attacked and defended with his ally Vasilevsky.\n\nZhukov remembered that the original essence of the Red Army, which he had forgotten because he had been swept away by a delegitimised reality, was always strong and overwhelming.\n\nHe then had countless stacks of paper prepared and began to write down what he wanted to pass on to the next generation."
 SOV_food_problem:0 "Food Problem"
 SOV_food_problem_desc:0 "If people don't eat, they will die. That is the natural order of things, no matter who you are. But it is not enough to let people plant their own food, but the reality is that in this harsh Urals land they have to struggle even to do that..."
 SOV_people_management:0 "People Management"
 SOV_people_management_desc:0 "The project that Suslov was working on was being completed. It was to recount the number of people currently living in the territory and to establish their whereabouts. It was to rectify the unregistered illegal population, the homeless, those who had died but not been erased, etc. This will enable the USSR to put all the people to work with the best possible manpower, without over- or under-working them.\n\n"All the peoples, since they belong to the Union, fulfil their duty to develop with us!""
 SOV_the_workers_rights:0 "The Workers' Rights"
 SOV_the_workers_rights_desc:0 "As long as the people labour in the state, it is hoped that the workers are more honest and productive. But still, an improvement on grievances is desired in this not by any means affluent plateau. \n\nOne day, the party received a petition. This is the whole story."
 SOV_be_exposed_to_poison:0 "Be Exposed to Poison"
 SOV_be_exposed_to_poison_desc:0 "Reformers discussed the current federal industry. Of particular importance is electronics, which has gained importance in recent years. The Federation's emphasis on the military and, moreover, the fact that it had to prioritise numbers over the quality of weapons, forced it to rely on analogue ones. In fact, radars and calculators can be said to be copies of German military equipment recovered from the Second Russo-German War. Presumably, there must be more sophisticated and advanced ones on the mainland of the superpowers.\n\nReformers secretly contacted the military and security services and carried out operations to smuggle American and German electronic equipment from the Arctic Ocean and from Finland, respectively. We take advantage of what we can from our enemies, even if it is taboo. That is one key to closing the gap in the future."
 SOV_campaigns_from_the_army:0 "Campaigns from the Army"
 SOV_campaigns_from_the_army_desc:0 "Zhukov's retirement could be a threat to the Red Army's position. There was widespread suspicion in the General Staff that the A move to the left? A recommendation to retire? Or a purge? The army somehow had to clarify its position in this succession battle.\n\nBut this is not the first time that Gorbachev's reformists have shown the army the cold eye. The reformists will probably play into our hands. Then it is natural to support the opposite."
 SOV_beyond_tomorrow:0 "Beyond Tomorrow"
 SOV_beyond_tomorrow_desc:0 "Even in decline, the Union will rise again. Is it for the good of the people? Yes, that too, but there is a reason beyond that. It is to take Russia back. Plans are afoot to develop the economy once more, and his successor has presented his own economic plan. \n\nAs before, Sousslov advocates a Soviet-style planned economy and the implementation of a clear economic policy by the regime. In other words, it guarantees a clear development in a robust process, independent of current conditions. However, this is also conditional on the people only complying, and we must be careful to play games with the workers.\n\nOn the contrary, Gorbachev advocates a departure from socialism and partial acceptance of the capitalist system. This opens up the possibility of competition in the economy between the peoples and more explosive development and progress than in a planned economy. However, such competition in this thin land will create new problems for the people and will require more government capacity to solve them."
 SOV_4th_five-year_plan:0 "4th Five-year Plan"
 SOV_4th_five-year_plan_desc:0 "Almost independently of the succession battle, the formulation of a plan is completed and implemented. This is the fourth five-year plan, the last major task under the Zhukov regime. Here, the aim is to develop the military industry and related industries, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the Red Army. Successful implementation of this will enable factories to handle more advanced and powerful weapons."
 SOV_bowing_out:0 "Bowing Out"
 SOV_bowing_out_desc:0 "Succession issues are well underway. I have compiled the items I need to pass on to the next generation. The office has been cleaned. All that remains is to leave gracefully.\n\nThe last days of the Zhukov administration are beginning..."
 SOV_steel_suslov:0 "The Steel Man, Suslov"
 SOV_steel_suslov_desc:0 "Wins of Suslov!"
 SOV_reform_gorbachev:0 "The Reformist, Gorbachev"
 SOV_reform_gorbachev_desc:0 "Wins of Gorbachev!"
#National Spirits
 SOV_distorted_nation:0 "Distorted Nation"
 SOV_distorted_nation_desc:0 "The USSR since 1941 has survived because of the military's first aid response to the collapse of the government, so although there is a Communist Party, the reality is a military-led military state. This led to a government in which the opinions of the military took precedence, leading to bureaucratic inefficiency.\nFortunately, the political skills of Vasilevsky and Zhukov were sufficient to ensure that the USSR did not collapse internally, bringing a measure of stability. Communist, military and autocratic government. That is the true state of the USSR today..."
 SOV_red_army:0 "Red Army"
 SOV_red_army_desc:0 "The Red Army's strength in the face of the overwhelmingly inferior two-front campaign against Germany and Japan in 1941, and the subsequent inferior war against Germany and internal divisions, has been recognised by many countries as a strength in itself. Especially on the defensive front, the legacy of the Red Army's efficient organisation of the front line, reinforcements and the strong resistance of the defensive positions themselves has been passed down to the present day as the absolute strength of the Red Army and their own self-confidence.\n\nHowever, such strength has been somewhat weakened by the current shortage of soldiers, which is not sufficient to defend the homeland. Quite simply, the number of young men themselves has been reduced due to repeated wars. Rebuilding the Red Army has not been an easy road."
 SOV_rigid_officers:0 "Rigid Officers"
 SOV_rigid_officers_desc:0 "The federal government is under a military government in which many military personnel participate, and many officers have political authority. At present, this system is not seen as a problem because the Union can be maintained under this system, but when the Union reaches the stage of reconstruction, military officers, who are not experts in politics in the first place, will instantly be replaced as obstacles within the government.\nIn addition, as much of the content of the Soviet Union's wars was defensive lines, the generals at the top tended to focus more on the defensive lines and, conversely, were less adept at attacking. Although there is a willingness among young officers to change this, they still have little say."
