#National Spirits
 SOV_distorted_nation:0 "Distorted Nation"
 SOV_distorted_nation_desc:0 "The USSR since 1941 has survived because of the military's first aid response to the collapse of the government, so although there is a Communist Party, the reality is a military-led military state. This led to a government in which the opinions of the military took precedence, leading to bureaucratic inefficiency.\nFortunately, the political skills of Vasilevsky and Zhukov were sufficient to ensure that the USSR did not collapse internally, bringing a measure of stability. Communist, military and autocratic government. That is the true state of the USSR today..."
 SOV_red_army:0 "Red Army"
 SOV_red_army_desc:0 "The Red Army's strength in the face of the overwhelmingly inferior two-front campaign against Germany and Japan in 1941, and the subsequent inferior war against Germany and internal divisions, has been recognised by many countries as a strength in itself. Especially on the defensive front, the legacy of the Red Army's efficient organisation of the front line, reinforcements and the strong resistance of the defensive positions themselves has been passed down to the present day as the absolute strength of the Red Army and their own self-confidence.\n\nHowever, such strength has been somewhat weakened by the current shortage of soldiers, which is not sufficient to defend the homeland. Quite simply, the number of young men themselves has been reduced due to repeated wars. Rebuilding the Red Army has not been an easy road."
 SOV_rigid_officers:0 "Rigid Officers"
 SOV_rigid_officers_desc:0 "The federal government is under a military government in which many military personnel participate, and many officers have political authority. At present, this system is not seen as a problem because the Union can be maintained under this system, but when the Union reaches the stage of reconstruction, military officers, who are not experts in politics in the first place, will instantly be replaced as obstacles within the government.\nIn addition, as much of the content of the Soviet Union's wars was defensive lines, the generals at the top tended to focus more on the defensive lines and, conversely, were less adept at attacking. Although there is a willingness among young officers to change this, they still have little say."
